This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML related to the use of `innerHTML`. The `bug.html` file showcases the incorrect use of `innerHTML`, while `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected approach. The primary issue stems from repeatedly appending to `innerHTML` without properly managing the resulting HTML structure, potentially leading to unexpected results,  reduced performance, or cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the appended content is not properly sanitized.
